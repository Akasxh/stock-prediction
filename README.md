# Stock Prediction Chat Bot using Python and gradio

We have completed a project on predicting stock values based on user input. The project was developed using `Python` and `Gradio`. 

---

We utilized the `Random Forest Regressor` algorithm for the prediction model. To retrieve the stock data, we used the `yfinance()` library and obtained the `AAPL` dataset.

---

 Users can input a specific date and get a prediction of the stock value for that day.
